#First Aid git

## How to run

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start` to start the Webpack development mode
3. `npm build` to start the Webpack build

## Make a build

Gulp.js is used to generate the Webpack build and take care of copying the assets to a build
folder.

Make sure to have gulp installed and run:

`gulp build`

To generate a deployable version.

## Using the CLI

There's an experimental CLI for First Aid Git!

You can install it via npm by doing:

`npm install -g firstaidgit`

And use by running `firstaidgit your search` from your terminal.
